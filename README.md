2-Dimentional-Separating-Axis-Theorem

This program is a basic example of how the 2 Dimentional Separating Axis Theorem can by applied to polygons.
By finding the normal vector of every edge of each shape and taking the dot product with each vertex of each shape,
the shapes can be projected onto the axes. If the projections do not intersect, the shapes are not touching. If
the projects do intersect for every axis, then the shapes must be touching.
